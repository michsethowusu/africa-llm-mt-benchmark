You can have the upper hand and still feel some way.,religious
You can have a check at hand of a million dollars and still be broke until you cash the check.,religious

Fear is become stronger than ever before.,religious
"Some of the things you hear on the news, on social media is very worrying.",religious
I believe that we need to revisit the subject of fear.,religious
Fear is not a feeling.,religious
Fear is not a thought.,religious
Fear is not an imagination.,religious
Fear is not your circumstances.,religious
Fear is a person.,religious
He will always hide behind situations and circumstances so that we forget that it's a person.,religious
Fear is one of the strongest adversaries that the enemy uses.,religious
He releases that spirit called fear.,religious
"When fear comes in, it opens you up to other things to come in.",religious
"Fear can cause a crack, a little opening, and a little hole for the enemy to come in to kill, to steal, and to destroy.",religious

"I believe God against all opposition and against all contradiction that at the end of these 100 days of prayer and fasting that all the things that have buffeted you, afflicted you and the stubborn situations in your life, they will come to an end in the name of Jesus.",religious
For God has not given us the spirit of fear.,religious
Fear is a spirit and is one of the strongest weapons Satan deploys against everyone.,religious
There are about 700 different kinds of fear.,religious
"Fear is a serpent with many, many, many heads.",religious
Victory over fear is the title of the message.,religious
That is what fear does.,religious
Fear will open you up and invite the adversary.,religious
"It operates in many, many ways and it will torture your mind, your emotions, and compel you to speak death.",religious
"As you begin to speak death, it invites the adversary to come in.",religious
Death and life are in the power of the tongue.,religious
"Whatever words you speak, they are seed.",religious
"Eventually, it will become a fruit that you have to eat yourself.",religious
So you got to watch what comes out of your mouth when you are afraid.,religious
Whatever you are afraid of is Satan's plan and agenda for your life.,religious
He's showing you his plans and desire and what he wishes and expects to befall you.,religious
"But today, whatever plan Satan has for our lives, our loved ones, this house, and our nation, by divine authority on the account of the blood of Jesus Christ, let it be intercepted and arrested.",religious

But the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me.,religious
And that which I was afraid of has come onto me.,religious

What if you die prematurely?,religious
What will happen to your kids?,religious

And I will return in safety and in one piece.,religious

And I'll return safely in one piece to my dwelling without fail in the name of Jesus.,religious
For I am free of fear.,religious
You have to let fear know that I am free of you.,religious
You have no power over me.,religious
Your inability to say it is an indication that you are a slave to it.,religious
I am not a slave to fear.,religious
I am free. I'm free of fear. I'm free of the spirit of fear.,religious
"Job for nine months, he couldn't make sense of his pain.",religious

It was exactly what he feared that came upon him.,religious
I renounce my fears.,religious
I renounce fear.,religious
Fear is not of God.,religious
I have no fear.,religious
"For God has not given me a spirit of fear, but has given me power, love, and of a sound mind.",religious
I break the power of the spirit of fear over my life and future.,religious
"I violently uproot and attack the very stronghold of fear in my subconscious mind, heart, soul, and spirit.",religious
You don't overcome fear by strong willpower.,religious
Positive thinking doesn't overcome fear because fear is a spirit.,religious
You conquer and overcome fear by the power of Jesus' name and by the scriptures indwelling you.,religious
"Whenever you face challenges, what is in you will come out.",religious
What is in you will come out.,religious
That's why the word of God must dwell in you richly.,religious

Kwame Tua is the biggest traitor.h333,youtube comments
"Kofi karikari died on the road coming to be enstooled as king of Ashanti again but in the night when coming he began to vomiting, he couldn't survive before others who also died, so it was the turn of Tweneboana while quenmother Yaa achiaa was Premier the second.",youtube comments
