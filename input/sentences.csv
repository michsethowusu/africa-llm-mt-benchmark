political monologue,"Other people who are looking for jobs, if they hadn't won, then they will be parliamentary candidates who had worked for the party. A government that wants to work at this can collaborate effectively with civil society. A lot of new MPs are battling with campaign expenses and other challenges, so they need to be guided. A lot of the time, an MP's salary cannot deal with all this. After eight years, Galamsey has won. After parliament has done its own orientation, as a political party, we also going to do our orientation. All the challenges to the process have so far failed. Aquatia is one of the swing seats and it has been swinging since 1992. Aquatia will not turn out to be a violent election. As a party, we are yet to do orientation for our MPs. Because if you're a candidate and you decide that you won't pay money, you lose. Can they survive on their MP salary and small committee allowances? Can we pass a legislation that says don't buy votes? Candidates who try but could not go to parliament but have contributed to the party will legitimately be looking for placement. Citizens can petition, and the elected person is bound to take followup actions. Each of the 276 constituencies are constituencies of their own. Elections are mostly for people with deep pockets, especially at the parliamentary level. Extracting minerals is not a bad idea; it's a legitimate economic activity. Ghanaians have almost effectively given the NDC a one-party state in parliament. I agree with the majority of Ghanaians who think that something must be done to the judiciary. I am not satisfied with the way the judiciary has been handling itself. I am urging people to reason with us and bring up more suggestions. I am very clear in my mind that the commission is not fit for purpose. I don't know where in our constitution a right is granted to an accused person to choose a court building. I don't subscribe to the declaration of a state of emergency. I'm looking for a situation where it will be possible in the future to actually re-orient the population. If some of our people walk out and you are left with 60 MPs, they still can do business. If the same Ghanaians whose opinions were pulled are now taking steps to correct what they perceive to be wrong. If there is that cost that needs to be paid, it will put pressure on the MP to get income from elsewhere. If there's a problem with the judiciary, it has to be reformed to undertake its constitutional duties. If votes are bought from you, it's like you have been enslaved. If you extract minerals wrongly, it can bring challenges that are more costly than the value gained. If your intention is to deal with Galamsey and you declare a state of emergency, people can shoot and kill at will. It doesn't lie in her mouth to say that if that is how the judiciary has been functioning under your leadership. It is a challenge now to look for other means of sustaining some of the gains of the revolution in the area of monetization of politics and corruption. It is a failure, some system failures, that has created that problem. It is an independent body that should be left alone. It tells you how intractable the problem is. It will not be easy, but it is worth trying because therein lies the sustenance of our democracy. It would not work unless you have strong political will from the leadership. It's a challenge to our democracies, but it's something that we must start and work at gradually. Luckily, we have a bipartisan consensus that the commission is not fit for purpose. Minister salary is also not able to take care of the demands. MPs are also having a lot of responsibilities. MPs in parliament may stop coming because they will be bored or angry. MPs say they don't support the removal of the Chief Justice and went on the streets to demonstrate. Not everybody thinks that going to parliament is just a stepping stone to becoming a minister or somebody else. People queue in front of their homes every day asking for them to take care of them, pay fees, go to funerals. President Akufo-Addo put his presidency on the line to fight Galamsey. President Mahama is not the one sitting in judgment; he's obliged to refer the matter to a committee."
political monologue,"Pressure will be brought to bear on elected leadership. Preventing them is not the same thing as stopping them. Reports of over-monetization of our politics are concerning. Revolution means changing from one system to the other. Sustaining the new system is another challenge altogether. That is also another system challenge that we need to deal with. That would be a difficult re-orientation to do. The 1992 constitution has said there shall be no one-party state. The 2024 election went into some controversies. The Americans didn't overcome theirs within 24 hours. The confidence of Ghanaians in our judicial system has so badly eroded. The constitution provides for the right of citizens who feel that a state institution is not delivering. The cost of going to parliament far exceeds the MP's salary for the four years. The elected official has no obligation to do what you want. He has already paid you. The executive has done nothing about the removal of the Chief Justice. The fight appears the Galamsey fight is winning again. The issue of Galamsey is bigger than anybody anticipated. The judiciary is not under attack; there is a reform of state institutions. The key leaders in our party are former MPs, so we've gone through those same experiences. The MP salary is not that much. The NDC government stands accused of trying to remove the Chief Justice. The only option available under a democratic dispensation is to go to court. The opinion of the people who petitioned is that the Chief Justice should be removed. The people who create the legislation are the beneficiaries of the system. The process is unfolding; let us see where it takes us. The revolution succeeded in introducing certain changes, but the methods used cannot be continued under a democratic dispensation. The revolution was supposed to stop a lot of things from happening. The system of getting people elected to parliament is becoming problematic. The work of an MP is not to find money and share to people who voted for him. There is a concern that that majority may be wrongly used. They passed effective legislation and made sure that those pieces of legislation were enforced. They will always resort to demanding from their officials. UK they didn't overcome it within 24 hours, but they passed legislation and refined their democracy. Unfortunately, we didn't win, but the following year we won. Violent clashes have led to the destruction of results of some polling stations. We don't have this social questioning for people below the poverty line. We have a vibrant civil society. We have assured the police that if anybody is going to interfere in their way of doing things, it will not be NDC. We have maintained our position all along that the Electoral Commission is problematic. We haven't changed anything at the judiciary. We said that we will reset state institutions which are not functioning according to the way they should function in a democracy. We still have the power as citizens to petition for her removal. We went to court to stop the declared MP from being sworn in. When parties are in power, they support institutions; when out of power, they withdraw support. Why was it necessary for us to file candidates in all 276 constituencies during the elections if we didn't want to win? Winning your seat is employment in itself. You can find a way of holding people to account for the cost of their elections and their expenses. You can introduce legislation that will punish people who buy votes. You have to literally buy your way into parliament. You need to manage the expectations of people around you."
religious,"It's time to feed your faith and starve your doubts. It's time to feed on the word of God. Thanks be to God who causes us to triumph always by Christ Jesus. Triumph means celebrating the victory. Triumph and confessing the word has nothing to do with the way you feel. It has everything to do with your faith. It has everything to do with what the word says. You can have the upper hand and still feel some way. You can have a check at hand of a million dollars and still be broke until you cash the check. Faith is a check. Today I want you to cash the check. Fear is become stronger than ever before. Some of the things you hear on the news, on social media is very worrying. I believe that we need to revisit the subject of fear. Fear is not a feeling. Fear is not a thought. Fear is not an imagination. Fear is not your circumstances. Fear is a person. He will always hide behind situations and circumstances so that we forget that it's a person. Fear is one of the strongest adversaries that the enemy uses. He releases that spirit called fear. When fear comes in, it opens you up to other things to come in. Fear can cause a crack, a little opening, and a little hole for the enemy to come in to kill, to steal, and to destroy. It doesn't matter how fortified one may be when fear sets in, there is an opening for the adversary to come in. If for whatever reason a particular day you are unable to fast, don't worry. Still pray, still do your prayers, still enforce the scriptures, and don't worry at all. Another opportunity will come for you to fast. Continue the prayers three times a day. I believe God against all opposition and against all contradiction that at the end of these 100 days of prayer and fasting that all the things that have buffeted you, afflicted you and the stubborn situations in your life, they will come to an end in the name of Jesus. For God has not given us the spirit of fear. Fear is a spirit and is one of the strongest weapons Satan deploys against everyone. There are about 700 different kinds of fear. Fear is a serpent with many, many, many heads. Victory over fear is the title of the message. That is what fear does. Fear will open you up and invite the adversary. It operates in many, many ways and it will torture your mind, your emotions, and compel you to speak death. As you begin to speak death, it invites the adversary to come in. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Whatever words you speak, they are seed. Eventually, it will become a fruit that you have to eat yourself. So you got to watch what comes out of your mouth when you are afraid. Whatever you are afraid of is Satan's plan and agenda for your life. He's showing you his plans and desire and what he wishes and expects to befall you. But today, whatever plan Satan has for our lives, our loved ones, this house, and our nation, by divine authority on the account of the blood of Jesus Christ, let it be intercepted and arrested. Intercepted and arrested by the power of Jesus' name. It's very, very important when we are dealing with spiritual things for you to have an attitude of cooperation and faith to confront the enemy. But the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come on. He said it twice."
religious,"For nine solid months, Job faced an affliction, an adversary that his friends and loved ones could not make sense of. At the end of the nine months of affliction, when he prayed, God turned his captivity. But Job then later on when he sat down and reflected came to the conclusion that everything that happened to him was a result of fear. The fear he had of losing everything he had was exactly what happened to him. But the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me. And that which I was afraid of has come onto me. Turn to somebody and say, ""What are you afraid of?"" You'll be surprised of the things they will tell you. Everybody has a fear of something. If it is not confronted and dealt with, it could have serious implications, not right now, but in the future. When people speak, you can also tell what they are afraid of; it's in their confession. Fear comes in to torture you mentally and emotionally and to harass you to get you to start speaking your fears. He projects, it plants and sows a seed. What if you die prematurely? What will happen to your kids? What if this thing you are attempting to do doesn't work? What if you lose your job? You have no idea the fear and the torture that goes on. The enemy comes in and will torture you mentally. I will go to wherever I'm going and I will arrive at my destination in safety and in one piece. And I will return in safety and in one piece. I declare victory over fear by confessing. This is my confession that whenever I leave my house and my dwelling to go anywhere, I will arrive safely at my final destination in one piece. And I'll return safely in one piece to my dwelling without fail in the name of Jesus. For I am free of fear. You have to let fear know that I am free of you. You have no power over me. Your inability to say it is an indication that you are a slave to it. I am not a slave to fear. I am free. I'm free of fear. I'm free of the spirit of fear. Job for nine months, he couldn't make sense of his pain. He could not make sense of his adversity. His friends and loved ones couldn't make sense of it. Everything that has happened to him was a result of the fear he had. It was exactly what he feared that came upon him. I renounce my fears. I renounce fear. Fear is not of God. I have no fear. For God has not given me a spirit of fear, but has given me power, love, and of a sound mind. I break the power of the spirit of fear over my life and future. I violently uproot and attack the very stronghold of fear in my subconscious mind, heart, soul, and spirit. You don't overcome fear by strong willpower. Positive thinking doesn't overcome fear because fear is a spirit. You conquer and overcome fear by the power of Jesus' name and by the scriptures indwelling you. Whenever you face challenges, what is in you will come out. What is in you will come out. That's why the word of God must dwell in you richly. Because when the enemy comes, none of the things we play with, we seek after, we go after can deliver you but the word of God. There's only one thing he fears the most."
youtube comments,"This man brain must be protected, he is powerful respect sir. I am Ga and proud of the asante. Some of us Ga trace our lineage to some akan tribes. Long live Lawyer Anokye. Yes Lawyer Yaw Frimpong Anokye IWATCH you and Hon Interviews Huuum Thanks your job Asantes is Power full. Hmm, it's gets you close to tears at the point if you are an African, makes you teary if you are Ghanaian, and makes you wail if you are Asante. Almost cried, thank you, the great historian. This history is what some people don’t want to hear ..but what is written is written. I am a Ga but my grand mother was called Afia Sarpong because her grabd aunt was one of five ppl from juabeng who lost their way after the katamanso war and lande at osu. Their names were Nana Tiakwa, Owusu Afriyie Afia Sarpong obiri yeboa i forgotten the last . All from Asante juaben. There was a community war at osudoku in shai hills that was not ending until the whites intervened. When the whites detected those caused the war the were made to leave the place the left and moved all the way to create the present osu , it was there at osu five junction near the night market where they saw those young juabens sitting there looking sad and lost realizing they were asantes and knowing they have been defeated at the katamanso war took the women as wives and used the men fir work and that is how the got Osu Ashanti. Yessssss, first time hearing of my grand, grand grand father. Thank you so much. Your story is very true. GOD BLESS LAWYER ANOKYE FOR ENLIGHTENING US ABOUT THE RICH HISTORY OF THE GREAT ASHANTI KINGDOM. ONLY THE DOUBTING "" THOMASES"" WITH NEGETIVE MINSET WILL NOT ACCEPT THE RICH HISTORY OF ASHANTI KINGDOM OF OLD GHANA. INDEED THE QUEENS GARDEN CITY. Very intelligent man. What a wooowww. U need to go to all media station. Wow! ThIs lawyer is very knowledgeable. Great! ,Great ,Great ! Am proud to be Ashanti. Great history. Wonderful! I didn’t know that the Ashanti empire was that great. This man is supper, he knows it all. I am Fante but proud that even before the arrival of europeans, Africans were great and on expeditions. Well done. Am proud of an Asanti. Beautiful and amazing too far my Ashanti. Forever Loving The Asantehene Kingdom. Eeeeiiii Aden Koraanie ASANTEFOUR YAKOYANO. The man is brilliant. I even don't wanna hear the name Kwame Tuah again , by the way, I love this man because everything is on point. The Asante History !!! This man saying good things about the wicked abrofo when they caused major issues. Wow interesting history. Ashanti and the Kingdom shall be great again. Yaa Asantewaa is intelligent. Long live Lawyer. Great historian. Yaa Asantewaa’s speech “ countrymen, it has come to my notice that many of you are losing confidence in me as a queen mother, let us prove to our enemies that they can’t spirit us”. Asante Kingdom still lives forever. This man mix fact history with oral history. Nice one. Can this man pls write a book on all this? I think to some extent the fall of the Ashanti empire has to do with Kwame Tuah who kept snitching on his own people. Yaa Asantewaa was first sent to a hidden village called Akwaboa, then to Asakraka, near Mfensi, then when she was being chased, she went to Domeabra-Mpasaaaso, another hidden Ashanti village where she was traced and captured by the British Troops."
youtube comments,"Point of correction lawyer. Jan kwa or Jan Corney wasn't an Nzema. He was an Ahanta, and Princess Town is also a small town in Ahantaland. Even the people of Axim are not Nzemas, but Ahantas. Perry-Martin field gun, currently on display at the Kumasi military museum (Kumasi Fort). It's an artillery piece, not a bomb. Proper Game of thrones. Piawwwwww️. Asante religion. Asanteman Ay3 bi ooooooo !!!!! Curse be upon whoever created division between Ewes and Asantes. Proud Ashant, kum apem a apem b3ba. Perry Martin bomb aka premoo Ato. In 1874, the Royal household took refuge in the village of Apampatia, near Ejisu. Kwaku Dua, a four-year-old royal earned the nickname ""Prempeh"", meaning detestable times. The village of Apampatia is now a suburb of of Odaho. The boy Kwaku Duah went on to become Asantehene at the age of 18. Prempeh is the corrupted form of Brempeh (br3 a y3mp3= br3mpeh=Prempeh). By 1828 British passed a law to have nothing to do with Gold Coast. It was 1843 when Maclean came to Gold Coast to represent the Company of Merchants. It was in 1844 when Comander Hill came to Gold Coast sign the treaty with the Coastal chiefs. Is not wenniba, is Senya Beraku. The is a village call Bonsukuo, where they settle. i want to download this video. This man must write a book on history b4 the worse happen. History is narrated differently from every side. Other tribes like Fantes also have their own narrative. I don't think anyone will name his son Tuah. Sheep among the wolf. I heard that, they chose Prempeh as the next king instead of Kwame Tua. That’s why he did that. Pls where is that HISTORY Books? Adansi piaaaaaaaw we are the best. The name of the Juabeng hene was Boakye tenten which was corrupted to Boateng. Who was Captain Afrifa in the Ashanti war? Thanks for sharing this Asante bacame British colony and it's British colony. The Ashanti Empire is still alive today. Otumfuor is still the greatest king in Ghana. God will punish Kwame Tua’s ghost. Was Akwamu who settled in Ivory Coast, not Bono Manso rather along the River Cumoi. Bono left Yefri to Bono manso and they discovered earth quack there so they moved downward to Takyiman. Which means Ashanti kingdom goes beyond one tribe. Africa must be gmreat again. Kwame Tua is the biggest traitor.h333 Kofi karikari died on the road coming to be enstooled as king of Ashanti again but in the night when coming he began to vomiting, he couldn't survive before others who also died, so it was the turn of Tweneboana while quenmother Yaa achiaa was Premier the second. Take your time and go back to the history. It shouldn't be the down fall of Asanti,,,,u must own ,,,. Asantes are kind, they love strangers, Ewes, Nortners and the other tribes in Ghana hate strangers. Please the King of that time of war of Juaben, was Nana Kwaku Boateng. Which Ashanti King was able to conquer Dahomey and Nigeria and togo. The last part nkoaa is wrong. He returned as still the Asantehene. The kumasihene takes care of the whole. Lawyer Anokye Frimpong is a historian."
